A little utility to unpack lz4json files as generated by Firefox's book mark backups.
This is a different format from what the normal lz4 utility expects.
The data is dumped to stdout.

Requires liblz4 to be installed and a little endian host

lz4jsoncat ~/.mozilla/.../bookmarkbackups/bookmarks-2014-12-27_151_0UCIWGB4x3hhQXpuSMs5WQ==.jsonlz4
